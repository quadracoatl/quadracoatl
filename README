Quadracoatl
===========

Quadracoatl is an engine for moddable, multiplayer bloxel games created with
Lua.

Its goal is to provide a feature rich platform for creating and powering
bloxel games of all kinds with the following goals:

 * Multiplayer by default, Singleplayer is "just offline/direct multiplayer".
 * Core API written in Java, scriptable in Lua.
 * Games are moddable by default, a "game" is just a fancy package for mods.
 * Client can connect to any server, the lient receives all necessary
   information/data/logic from the server upon connecting to it.
